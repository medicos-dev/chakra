# Chakra VPN

A production-grade, single-server VPN mobile app that routes all internet traffic through a self-hosted WireGuard server.

## Features

- **One-Tap Connect**: Extremely simple interface - no manual configuration
- **Background Persistence**: VPN remains active even when app is closed
- **Auto-Reconnect**: Automatically reconnects on network changes
- **Full Tunnel VPN**: All traffic routed through VPN (WireGuard)
- **Persistent Notification**: Android notification tray with Connect/Disconnect actions
- **No DNS Configuration**: OS handles DNS resolution (no DNS field in config)

## Architecture

- **Single Server Model**: Exactly ONE VPN server (no switching)
- **WireGuard Protocol**: High performance, low latency VPN
- **Platform Native**: Android VpnService + iOS Network Extension
- **State Persistence**: User intent saved separately from VPN status
- **Secure Storage**: Keys stored in Android Keystore / iOS Keychain

## Setup

**Important**: See [VPN_SETUP.md](VPN_SETUP.md) for complete setup instructions, including:
- Server configuration
- Client peer setup
- Platform-specific implementation details
- WireGuard library integration
- Production readiness checklist

## Quick Start

1. **Set Server Endpoint**: Edit `lib/providers/vpn_provider.dart` and set `serverEndpoint`:
   ```dart
   static const String serverEndpoint = 'your-ddns-hostname.ddns.net:51820';
   ```

2. **Add Server Peer**: On your Windows WireGuard server, add a `[Peer]` block with the client's public key (generated by the app)

3. **Build & Run**: 
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

## Requirements

- Flutter SDK 3.7.2+
- Android: API 21+ (Android 5.0+)
- iOS: iOS 12.0+
- WireGuard server running on Windows laptop

## Important Notes

- **DNS**: No DNS is configured anywhere. OS handles DNS resolution.
- **Background Operation**: VPN runs independently of app UI. Closing app does not disconnect VPN.
- **Single Server**: Architecture assumes exactly one server. No server switching.
- **Key Security**: Private keys never leave the device. Only public keys are shared with server.
